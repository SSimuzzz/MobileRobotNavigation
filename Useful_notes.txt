To kill ros processes without having to restart the docker container:
open another shell
docker ps 			--> trova il nome del container
docker exec -it <nome> "/bin/bash"
pkill -f gazebo
pkill -f roslaunch

Robot starting position is (-2, -0.5). Where to change it?

Would be very nice to visualize current sampled goal on world map. Have no idea how.

In File modificati folder there are all the files modified for running in the docker. You have to replace the corresponding ones in the running container with these.

After training is completed, a file data about the training process will be saved in my_turtlebot3_openai_example/training_results/metrics.csv

Place plot_metrics3.py in my_turtlebot3_openai_example/scripts/ and run it. It will generate plots in training_results/ using data from metrics.csv
